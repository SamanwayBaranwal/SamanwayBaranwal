# Hi, I’m Samanway

I am 16 years old and from India. I am a blockchain developer and I love working with Web3, crypto, and AI. I enjoy learning new things and building tools that can help other developers.

I have experience in JavaScript, Solidity, React, Node.js, and web development. I also work on personal branding, marketing, and social media. I have worked with some of India’s top YouTubers to help them grow their audience.

I created **Owl AI**, a tool that helps developers create smart contracts easily using simple English commands. It was born because I faced many problems like bugs, errors, and no smart tools for blockchain development.

I believe Base  Blockchain is the next big platform, and I want to launch on it and work with their community.

Right now, I am building more tools and looking for help with APIs, hosting, and setup costs. Even $1 support means a lot!

If you want to talk, share ideas, or support my work, feel free to connect with me. I’m always open to discussions.

Let’s build something real together!

and yes i have built so many Dapps but dont pushed it on github!
